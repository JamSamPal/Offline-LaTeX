# Offline-LaTeX
Lightweight, offline LaTeX editor

# To run:
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base

python autolatex <path/to/file.tex> [<path/to/output/directory>]

(Edit your file.tex in e.g. VsCode and when you hit save the script should (re)generate a compiled pdf.)

Hitting 's' + Enter should save a copy of the project to a history folder allowing easier restoration.
